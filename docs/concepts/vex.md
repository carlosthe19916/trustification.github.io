# VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange)

VEX is a form of a security advisory, similar to those already issued by mature product security
teams toda

The goal of Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) is to allow a software supplier or other
parties to assert the status of specific vulnerabilities in a particular product

## What can you expect from a VEX?

- **Vulnerability details**: Provides additional information on a specific vulnerability, such that it can serve as a comprehensive list of associated vulnerabilities to a specific vulnerable component.
- **Vulnerability context**: As a companion document to the SBOM, it also provides additional vulnerability context to discovered components (as part of the SBOM) in software products and whether they are exploitable in that particular environment. In essence, the VEX is a diagnostic tool that pinpoints what vulnerabilities really matter.
- **Remediation guidance**: In case these components are exploitable, available remediation options are recommended.
- **Automation support**: Supports automation for effective vulnerability management, tracking, and remediation.
- **Focus on what matters most**: Enables organizations to focus on vulnerabilities that are exploitable and save time by not fixing vulnerabilities that pose no risk to the organization.
