# What is software supply chain security

Software supply chain security combines best practices from risk management and cybersecurity to help protect the software supply chain from potential vulnerabilities. The software supply chain is made up of everything and everyone that touches your code in the software development lifecycle (SDLC), from application development to the CI/CD pipeline and deployment.

The supply chain includes networks of information about the software, like the components (e.g. infrastructure, hardware, operating systems (OS), cloud services, etc.), the people who wrote them, and the sources they come from, like registries, GitHub repositories, codebases, or other open source projects. It also includes any vulnerabilities that may negatively impact software security – and that’s where software supply chain security comes in.

## Why is software supply chain security critical?

Most software today isn’t written from scratch – it’s typically a combination of software artifacts containing open source software. However, these software artifacts are subject to vulnerabilities, and developers have less control over source code from a third party or any changes made to a software artifact over time. It’s important to note that unpatched software is more susceptible to security issues. Because software is essential to executing daily business operations, supply chain security is a crucial responsibility of every organization and security team.

Software company SolarWinds was breached in 2020 when attackers launched malicious code via its Orion IT monitoring and management software, a platform used among large corporations and government agencies. By attacking the supply chain, the hackers infiltrated not only SolarWinds but their customers as well. Log4j is a commonly used but widely exploitable open source software that has left countless users and organizations susceptible to data breaches and attacks. In 2021, the president of the United States highlighted the importance of software supply chains and security with 2 White House executive orders: supply chains and cybersecurity.

## What are the security risks to the software supply chain?

Risk to any component of the software supply chain presents a potential risk to every software artifact relying on that supply chain component. It provides hackers the opportunity to insert malware, a backdoor, or other malicious code to compromise any components and their associated supply chains. Software supply chain attacks, commonly carried out by profit threat actors and nation state actors, are rising and can have dramatic effects in both our digital and physical worlds. These generally fall into one of four types of risks:

- Vulnerabilities: are flaws in software code that could be exploited leading to a breach. Patch and update your software artifacts to minimize this risk
- Licensing: is a legal risk that could obligate you to make any resulting software artifacts open source and nullify patent rights. Consult legal experts in this area.
- Third party dependencies: are any dependency upon any outside organization as part of the software supply chain and are difficult to know. Analyze all third party code and talk to your suppliers about how they protect you.
- Processes and policies: are a problem if you do not have them. Create policies for your developers and processes (or playbooks) for when you need to respond to a vulnerability.

Common attack vectors include hijacking updates, undermining code signing, and compromising open source code.
